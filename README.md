# ML-Practice
This repository contains basic machine learning approaches for different datasets from UCI ML repository {http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php}
Currently the first two notebooks in CS229 folder implement prediction approaches of Least mean squares(LMS) and logistic regression.
For Linear regression, gradient descent is implement by LMS algorithm and for logistic regression, the newton-raphson method is implemented
for prediction of heart disease from a cleveland dataset
